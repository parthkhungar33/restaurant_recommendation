Problem Statement: AI-Powered Restaurant Recommendation System (Zomato Use Case)
You are tasked with building an AI-powered restaurant recommendation service inspired by Zomato. The system should intelligently suggest restaurants based on user preferences by combining structured data with a Large Language Model (LLM).
Objective
Design and implement an application that:
•	Takes user preferences (such as location, budget, cuisine, and ratings)
•	Uses a real-world dataset of restaurants
•	Leverages an LLM to generate personalized, human-like recommendations
•	Displays clear and useful results to the user
System Workflow
1.	Data Ingestion
o	Load and preprocess the Zomato dataset from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/ManikaSaini/zomato-restaurant-recommendation )
o	Extract relevant fields such as restaurant name, location, cuisine, cost, rating, etc.
2.	User Input
o	Collect user preferences:
	Location (e.g., Delhi, Bangalore)
	Budget (low, medium, high)
	Cuisine (e.g., Italian, Chinese)
	Minimum rating
	Any additional preferences (e.g., family-friendly, quick service)
3.	Integration Layer
o	Filter and prepare relevant restaurant data based on user input
o	Pass structured results into an LLM prompt
o	Design a prompt that helps the LLM reason and rank options
4.	Recommendation Engine
o	Use the LLM to:
	Rank restaurants
	Provide explanations (why each recommendation fits)
	Optionally summarize choices
5.	Output Display
o	Present top recommendations in a user-friendly format:
	Restaurant Name
	Cuisine
	Rating
	Estimated Cost
	AI-generated explanation
